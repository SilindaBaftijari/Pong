# Python Pong Game

## Introduction
This is a simple implementation of the classic Pong game created using Python's Turtle graphics library. The game features two paddles and a ball, and the objective is to bounce the ball past your opponent's paddle to score points.

## How to Play
- Player 1 (left paddle) can control their paddle using the 'W' key to move up and the 'S' key to move down.
- Player 2 (right paddle) can control their paddle using the 'Up' arrow key to move up and the 'Down' arrow key to move down.
- The game starts with a score of 0 for both players.
- Each time the ball passes the opponent's paddle, the corresponding player's score increases by 1.
- The game continues indefinitely until you decide to close the window.

## Dependencies
- This game is built using Python's Turtle graphics library, which is included in the standard Python library.
